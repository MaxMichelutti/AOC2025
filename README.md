# Advent of Code 2025

This year we have a shorter than usual, 12-days advent of code.<br>

I will be publishing my solutions here, but since I am very busy lately, I will likely finish later than December 12th.<br>

Anyway, at least I remembered this year, so it will definitely be better than 2024.<br>

For this year, I plan to develop a decent Rust solution for each problem, since in the last few months, Rust has been my most used programming language. <br>

Feel free to use these solutions if you are stuck, but please, in the spirit of the challenge, try to come up with a solution of your own before relying on someone else's.
